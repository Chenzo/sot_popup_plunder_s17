## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Timezone Detection**: Uses the browser's `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` API to detect the user's timezone
2. **Time Conversion**: Converts UTC times to local times using JavaScript's built-in Date methods
3. **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes event status every minute
4. **Status Calculation**: Determines if events are past, upcoming, or urgent based on current time
